Create a basic admin-only web application with login authentication and a shared database that works across multiple devices.

1. Login System
	•	Login page with 3 demo accounts (clickable):
	•	Sender
	•	Receiver
	•	Admin
	•	No public access, admins only.

⸻

2. Sender Account (Selling by KG)

The sender sells items by kilogram.

Product System
	•	Each item has:
	•	Name
	•	Price per 1 KG (IQD)
	•	Image (uploadable)
	•	Ability to:
	•	Add new items
	•	Edit prices
	•	Edit names
	•	Change images
	•	Delete items

Items & Prices (IQD / KG):
	•	Fstq akbary – 18,500
	•	Noky irany brzhaw – 4,000
	•	Mewzh ozbaki – 8,000
	•	Tekalay charas – 14,000
	•	Gulla barozha – 4,500
	•	Tekala taybat – 18,000
	•	Ganma shami – 4,500
	•	Muqarmsh – 4,250
	•	Kolaka kam xwe – 7,000
	•	Gwez sax – 6,000
	•	Alibaba sada – 4,500
	•	Badam swer – 14,000
	•	Fstq ahmady – 16,500
	•	Kolakay spi – 7,500
	•	Gazo sada – 15,500

KG Calculation Logic
	•	When selecting a product:
	•	User enters amount in IQD
	•	System calculates exact KG
	•	Example:
	•	Gulla barozha = 4,500 IQD / KG
	•	User enters 1,000 IQD
	•	Result: 0.222 KG

Basket System
	•	Selected items go into a basket
	•	Basket shows:
	•	Item name
	•	Price per KG
	•	Paid amount
	•	Calculated KG
	•	Button: Continue Purchase
	•	Order is sent to Receiver instantly

⸻

3. Receiver Account
	•	Sees incoming orders in real-time
	•	Clear layout showing:
	•	Items
	•	KG
	•	Prices
	•	Total
	•	Ability to:
	•	Mark order as Finished / Completed

⸻

4. Admin Account
	•	Full access dashboard:
	•	Total sales
	•	Total profit
	•	Orders history
	•	Items sold by KG
	•	Revenue statistics
	•	Read-only for orders (cannot edit past orders)

⸻

5. Database & Tech Requirements
	•	Persistent database (orders, items, prices, images)
	•	Sync across multiple devices
	•	Data must not reset on refresh
	•	Simple, clean UI (not public-facing, admin-focused)


🔁 Dual Input System (IQD ↔ KG)

When selecting any product, the system must provide two calculation modes:

1️⃣ By IQD (Price-Based)
	•	User selects “By IQD”
	•	User enters the amount in IQD
	•	System automatically calculates the exact KG
	•	Example:
	•	Price: 4,500 IQD / KG
	•	Entered: 1,000 IQD
	•	Output: 0.222 KG
	•	Result is added to basket

⸻

2️⃣ By KG (Weight-Based)
	•	User selects “By KG”
	•	User enters weight (e.g. 0.25kg, 0.5kg, 1kg)
	•	System automatically calculates the price in IQD
	•	Result is added to basket

⸻

💰 IQD Rounding & Payment Suggestion Logic

Because customers cannot pay small irregular amounts:
	•	Valid payment steps:
	•	250 / 500 / 750 / 1,000 / 1,250 / 1,500 / etc
	•	When user enters KG and the calculated price is not payable:
	•	System shows smart suggestions
	•	Suggests the closest valid IQD amount
	•	Shows adjusted KG automatically

Example:
	•	Entered weight: 0.230 KG
	•	Calculated price: 1,195 IQD
	•	System suggests:
	•	1,000 IQD → adjusted KG
	•	1,250 IQD → adjusted KG
	•	User selects one option to proceed

⸻

🔗 Bi-Directional Sync
	•	Changing IQD updates KG
	•	Changing KG updates IQD
	•	Suggestions update in real-time
	•	Basket always reflects the final confirmed values
